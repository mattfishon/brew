TODO:  Angular is running in the development mode. Call enableProdMode() to enable the production mode.
look into the above!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


SpringInit gave me:  2.0.2.RELEASE...I changed to 1.5.12 to be like skymongo

This project is at workspace:  C:\Users\mblanchard.CT4400-Mblancha\Downloads\skydemo\skydemo

I installed nodejs into C:/tools/

I ran these since I had to uninstall ang 6.0
npm cache clean
npm cache verify

When I ran:
npm install -g @angular/cli@1.7.4
it seemed to install Angular in location:
C:\Users\tango\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\@angular

Now following instrs below in section 5 only to hook angular into spring boot:
https://www.djamware.com/post/5a792ecb80aca7059c142978/spring-boot-mongodb-and-angular-5-crud-java-web-application

1) ng new frontend 
This created a huge frontend directory (i.e Application)

2) Modified outDir as specified in - angular-cli.json
"outDir": "../src/main/resources/static",

3) cd to frontend and run  (install will install modules listed in package.json)
npm install
ng build

The above now puts stuff in src/main/resources/static/

Now used this link from beginning up to "The Resource Server" to get login working.
https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-security-and-angular-js/


NOTE:  After changes in frontend/app I have been in dir /frontend  using command ng build   
to regenerate files in my project static folder


Install Angular Material via this:
https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started
NOTE:  I did the install in my /frontend directory
Step 1:  I did as is
Step 2:  I skipped for now
Step 4:  Added to the styles.css
Step 5:  Skipped for now

And reinstall specific version:
....\frontend> npm install --save @angular/material@5.2.5  @angular/cdk@5.2.5

NOW:
1) Pulled in stuff from my saved off zip file.
2)  SpringInit gave me:  2.0.2.RELEASE so I updated POM to 1.5.12
3)  Added below to properties.yml and removed flavi.icon from static
security:
  ignored:
  - "*.bundle.*"
4) Now add new logic to handle Login and save user in localstorage, etc.


Add ngx-charts:
(  reference:   https://www.beyondjava.net/blog/charts-with-angular-ngx-charts-formerly-ng2d3/ )
(note:  look at his code for imports and such )
1) npm i --save @swimlane/ngx-charts@7.3.0  (seems version 8 has ang 6 depend)
2) npm install d3@5.1.0 --save  (seem to be the same time as above)   
2) npm i @types/d3@5.0.0 --save-dev
3)  Add below to angular-cli.json
"styles": [
   "styles.css",
   "../node_modules/@swimlane/ngx-charts/release/ngx-charts.css"
],
 
5) removed these 2 on bar and line to stop legend from showing
			  class="chart-container"
			  legend="false"
			  

NOTE:
1) /src/styles.css -   Add global ngx overrides as I can't get to work in component scss yet!
2) /src/polyfill.ts - Uncomment stuff for IE to work
