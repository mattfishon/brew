Install Angular locally to override global version:
npm install @angular/cli
I installed it locally at the project root folder...it created:
C:\project root\node_modules\@angular

Now following instrs below in section 5 only to hook angular into spring boot:
https://www.djamware.com/post/5a792ecb80aca7059c142978/spring-boot-mongodb-and-angular-5-crud-java-web-application

1) ng new frontend 
This created a huge frontend directory (i.e Application)

2) Modified outDir as specified
NOTE: With Ang 6 it seems to be angular.json file

3) cd to frontend and run  (install will install modules listed in package.json)
npm install
ng build

Install Angular Material via this:
https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started
NOTE:  I did the install in my /frontend directory
Step 1:  I did as is
Step 2:  I skipped for now
Step 4:  Added to the styles.css
Step 5:  Skipped for now
Step 6:  Added icon to index.


For Material I did:
npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk hammerjs
1) fixed output path ( I believe this is covered above with OutDir which in Ang6 is Output )
2) update styles.css
3) added matieral icon (step 6 above) to index
